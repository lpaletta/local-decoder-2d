# Code for "Local decoder for the toric code with a high pseudo-threshold"

This repository presents the code used for the numerical simulations in the paper "Local decoder for the toric code with a high pseudo-threshold". The code is organized into the five foolowing folders.

1. [convergence] Analysis of the convergence speed of the normalized jump rate to the logical error rate - (EM) Fig.5 (b-c)
2. [logical] Analysis of the logical error rate - (Main text) Fig.4 (a-b)
3. [threshold] Analysis of the threshold - (Main text) & Fig.4 (c)
4. [poisson] Verification that the logical failure behavior is Markovian Fig - (EM) Fig.5 (a)
5. [visualization] Space-time representation of the automaton - (Main text) Fig.3 (b)

Each folder includes a README.md file with more detailed information about the simulation performed for the corresponding figure.
